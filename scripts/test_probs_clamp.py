"""Verify that cubeless probability clamping enforces position invariants.

The multi-ply and truncated rollout evaluators must zero out impossible
outcomes:
  1. P(gl) and P(bl) when the player has at least one checker borne off.
  2. P(gw) and P(bw) when the opponent has at least one checker borne off.
  3. P(bl) when contact is broken AND the player has no checker in the
     opponent's home (19-24) or on bar (25).
  4. P(bw) when contact is broken AND the opponent has no checker in the
     player's home (1-6) or on bar (0).

This script picks positions that exercise each invariant and checks that
1-ply, 2-ply, 3-ply, and truncated/full rollout evaluations return probs
that match.
